# Phase 1 Week 1 Moringa Code Challenge

# Description

This is the project made for the first code challenge done in JavaScript, it contains three functions that each:

- Prompt a user to input student marks. The input should be between 0 and 100. Then outputs the correct grade: 

A > 79, B - 60 to 79, C -  59 to 49, D - 40 to 49, E - less 40.

- Take as input the speed of a car e.g 80. If the speed is less than 70, it should print “Ok”. Otherwise, for every 5 km/s above the speed limit (70), it should give the driver one demerit point and print the total number of demerit points.

For example, if the speed is 80, it should print: “Points: 2”. If the driver gets more than 12 points, the function should print: “License suspended”.

- Calculate an individual’s Net Salary by getting the inputs of basic salary and benefits. Calculate the paye (i.e. Tax), NHIFDeductions, NSSFDeductions, gross salary, and net salary. 

## Extra Features

- One of the extra features of the functions is that they account for misinputs by the user and reprompts the user to reinput their data correctly!
